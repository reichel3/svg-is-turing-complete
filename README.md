# SVG Is Turing Complete
Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML based language that describes the layout of images. It has significant image processing capabilities, as I demonstrate, these capabilities breach turing completeness.\
Since I hadn't seen a proof of this before, I thought I ought to go ahead and do it. \
Contained within this repo is a rather slow implementation of the [turing complete rule 110 cellular automata](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule110.html) in SVG.
