# SVG Is Turing Complete
Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML based language with significant image processing capabilities, and here I demonstrate that these capabilities breach turing completeness.\
\
The turing machine I choose to emulate to prove SVG's turing completeness is [rule 110](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule110.html).\
\
Runs in `Chromium 73.0.3683.103` after several seconds, seriously, this thing is slow!\

Technical information found in the source, for those further interested.
